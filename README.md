# DevOps
This is a 90-day DevOps learning mail where everything about DevOps will be found sequentially, useful for freshers, experienced, and even non-IT guys planning to switch to IT via DevOps.

>> DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the software development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. It focuses on collaboration, automation, and monitoring to ensure faster and more reliable software releases.

### Key Principles of DevOps:
**i. Collaboration**: Bridging the gap between development and operations teams to work together efficiently. 

**ii. Automation:** Automating repetitive tasks like code integration, testing, and deployment.

**iii. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Frequent code integration and automated deployment to production environments.

**iv. Monitoring and Feedback:** Real-time tracking of applications and infrastructure to provide insights and improvements.

**v. Security (DevSecOps):** Embedding security into the DevOps lifecycle to ensure secure applications.

### DevOps Lifecycle Phases:
**Plan:**
- Tools: Jira, Trello
- Agile methodologies to plan and track work progress.

**Develop:**
- Tools: Git, GitHub, GitLab
- Writing and managing code collaboratively.


**Build:**
- Tools: Maven, Gradle
- Compiling source code into deployable artifacts.

**Test:**
- Tools: Selenium, JUnit, TestNG
- Automated testing to ensure software quality.

**Release:**
- Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD
- CI/CD pipelines for smooth delivery.


**Deploy:**
- Tools: Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible
- Automating deployment in cloud or on-premise environments.

**Operate:**
- Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- Monitoring application performance and infrastructure health.

**Monitor:**
- Tools: Nagios, Splunk
- Continuous feedback and logging for improvements.
