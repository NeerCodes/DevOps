# DevOps
This is a 90-day DevOps learning mail where everything about DevOps will be found sequentially, useful for freshers, experienced, and even non-IT guys planning to switch to IT via DevOps.

> DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the software development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. It focuses on collaboration, automation, and monitoring to ensure faster and more reliable software releases.

### Key Principles of DevOps:
**i. Collaboration**: Bridging the gap between development and operations teams to work together efficiently. 

**ii. Automation:** Automating repetitive tasks like code integration, testing, and deployment.

**iii. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Frequent code integration and automated deployment to production environments.

**iv. Monitoring and Feedback:** Real-time tracking of applications and infrastructure to provide insights and improvements.

**v. Security (DevSecOps):** Embedding security into the DevOps lifecycle to ensure secure applications.

### DevOps Lifecycle Phases:
**Plan:**
- Tools: Jira, Trello
- Agile methodologies to plan and track work progress.

**Develop:**
- Tools: Git, GitHub, GitLab
- Writing and managing code collaboratively.


**Build:**
- Tools: Maven, Gradle
- Compiling source code into deployable artifacts.

**Test:**
- Tools: Selenium, JUnit, TestNG
- Automated testing to ensure software quality.

**Release:**
- Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD
- CI/CD pipelines for smooth delivery.


**Deploy:**
- Tools: Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible
- Automating deployment in cloud or on-premise environments.

**Operate:**
- Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- Monitoring application performance and infrastructure health.

**Monitor:**
- Tools: Nagios, Splunk
- Continuous feedback and logging for improvements.



## NETWORKING (for DevOps)
### All about Networking required for DevOps

The internet is a vast global network of optical fiber cables, many of which are laid under the ocean, enabling the transfer of data across the world.

These undersea cables are primarily owned and operated by Tier-1 companies, which form the backbone of the internet.

Internet Service Provider (ISP) Hierarchy
Tier-1 ISPs (Global Backbone Providers):

These companies own and maintain the core infrastructure, including submarine cables and major routing networks.
They provide connectivity to Tier-2 ISPs via direct peering agreements.
Examples: Tata Communications, AT&T, NTT Communications.
Tier-2 ISPs (Regional Providers):

They lease bandwidth from Tier-1 providers to extend connectivity to different regions or countries.
They may provide services to businesses and individual users or sell bandwidth to Tier-3 ISPs.
Examples: BSNL, Jio, Airtel.
Tier-3 ISPs (Local Providers):

They lease bandwidth from Tier-2 providers and offer internet access to end-users (homes and businesses).
They often focus on specific cities or localities and provide last-mile connectivity.
Examples: YOU Broadband, Craze Wifi, ion N/W, Jio Fiber.
