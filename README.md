- They provide connectivity to Tier-2 ISPs via direct peering agreements.
- Examples: Tata Communications, AT&T, NTT Communications.

#### Tier-2 ISPs (Regional Providers):
- They lease bandwidth from Tier-1 providers to extend connectivity to different regions or countries.
- They may provide services to businesses and individual users or sell bandwidth to Tier-3 ISPs.
- Examples: BSNL, Jio, Airtel.

#### Tier-3 ISPs (Local Providers):
- They lease bandwidth from Tier-2 providers and offer internet access to end-users (homes and businesses).
- They often focus on specific cities or localities and provide last-mile connectivity.
- Examples: YOU Broadband, Craze Wifi, ion N/W, Jio Fiber.


### <ins> OSI Model & TCP/IP Model </ins>

**Quick Summary:**
IPv6 solves IPv4's address exhaustion, offers better security, auto-configuration, and improved performance, but adoption is slower due to compatibility challenges.


### <ins> Subnet </ins>
**1. What is a Subnet?**
 - A subnet (short for "subnetwork") is a logically segmented portion of a larger network.
 - It divides a network into smaller, manageable sections to enhance performance, security, and organization.

**2. What is Subnetting?**
 - Subnetting is the process of splitting a larger IP network into smaller subnets.
 - This allows efficient utilization of IP addresses and reduces network congestion
 - Helps in isolating traffic for security and better control.

**3. Why is Subnetting Important?**
 - **Efficient IP Address Management:** Conserves IP addresses by avoiding wastage.
 - **Improved Network Performance:** Limits broadcast traffic within a subnet.
 - **Enhanced Security:** Isolates different network segments.
 - **Simplifies Administration:** Makes troubleshooting easier by segmenting networks.

**4. Key Components of Subnetting**

 - **IP Address:** Identifies a device on a network (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
  
 - **Subnet Mask:** Determines which part of the IP address is the network and which part is the **host**
   - Example: 255.255.255.0 (Class C network)..
  
 - **CIDR Notation:** Specifies the subnet mask using a /n format, where n is the number of bits in the network part.
   - Example: 192.168.1.1/24 means the first 24 bits are the network portion.

**5. Classes of IP Addresses (Default Subnet Masks)**

 - **Class - A**
   - **Range:** 0.0.0.0 ‚Äì 127.255.255.255
 
   - **Default Subnet Mask:** 255.0.0.0
   - **CIDR:** /8

 - **Class - B**

**6. How to Subnet?**
  - **Determine Subnet Requirements:**
      - Number of subnets needed.
      - Number of hosts per subnet.
   
  - **Calculate Subnet Mask:**
      - Use bits from the host portion to create more subnets.
      - Example: For 4 subnets, borrow 2 bits (since 2 <sup>2</sup> = 4).

  - **Divide IP Range:**
      - Split the IP range according to the new subnet mask.

  **7. Example of Subnetting**
  
  - Given an IP Address: 192.168.1.0/24
  
    - **Original Subnet Mask:** 255.255.255.0 (256 IPs, 2<sup>8</sup> ).
     
    - **Subnet into 4 networks:** Borrow 2 bits ‚Üí /26 (Subnet Mask = 255.255.255.192).
    - **New Subnet Ranges:**
        - 192.168.1.0 ‚Äì 192.168.1.63
        - 192.168.1.64 ‚Äì 192.168.1.127
        - 192.168.1.128 ‚Äì 192.168.1.191
        - 192.168.1.192 ‚Äì 192.168.1.255


  **8. Important Terms**
  - **Network Address:** First address in a subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0).
  - **Broadcast Address:** Last address in a subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.255).
  - **Usable Hosts:** Total addresses minus the network and broadcast addresses.
      - Example: For /26, 2<sup>6</sup> ‚àí2 = 62 usable addresses.


  **9. VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)**
  - Allows subnetting with different subnet masks in the same network.
  - More efficient IP allocation by customizing subnet sizes.

  **Summary:**
  - Subnetting helps divide a large network into smaller, manageable pieces.
  - It improves IP management, performance, and security.
  - Calculating subnets involves understanding binary operations and subnet masks.
